The printw function in ncurses uses the same format specifiers as the standard C printf function for formatting strings. Here are some of the common specifiers:

%d or %i: Signed decimal integer
%u: Unsigned decimal integer
%f: Decimal floating point
%s: String of characters
%c: Single character
%x or %X: Unsigned hexadecimal integer
%o: Unsigned octal
%p: Pointer address
%%: A literal % character
%e or %E: Scientific notation (e.g., 1.2e+2)
%g or %G: Use the shorter of %e or %f
%a or %A: Hexadecimal floating point (C99)
%n: The number of characters written so far is stored into the integer indicated by the int* (pointer) argument. No argument is converted.
%ld, %lld: Long and long long integer specifiers for %d and %i.
These specifiers can be used in combination with flags, width, precision, and length modifiers to control the formatting of the output. For example, %6.2f would format a floating-point number to have at least 6 characters wide and 2 characters after the decimal point.
